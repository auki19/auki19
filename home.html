            Welcome to my website! I'm Audrey, and I'm really just making this cuz I'm a huge nerd and want a little project to work on. I don't really use social media other than Tumblr, and I really love the customization of having my own site. <br>
            I'm a big fan of music, casual video games, reading, and podcasts.
